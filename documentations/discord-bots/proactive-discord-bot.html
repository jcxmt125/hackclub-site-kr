            <h2>Environment configuration</h2>

            <p>
                First, git clone the repo.<br>
                This bot requires additional modules: install them with "pip install -r requirements.txt".<br>
                It is recommended to do this in a venv.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                This script requires a .env file:<br>

                    <li>S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_URL: The public URL of your S3 bucket (will be displayed to users)</li>
                    <li>S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your S3 bucket</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>GEMINI_API_KEY: get one from Google's AI studio. Most LLM requests will use this.</li>
                    <li>DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: get one from Discord developer portal.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to install more programs not covered by Python dependancies:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>ImageMagick: Install it, and test that you can access it either via "magick" or "convert".</li>
                    <li>ffmpeg: Install it, and test you can access it on the cli.</li>
                </ul>
                Both need to be on your PATH.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage instructions</h2>

            <p>
                Invite your bot to a server from the provided installation URL on the Discord developer portal.<br>
                Run "bot_botmode_autoread.py". You must keep this running for the bot to work.<br>
                On linux CLI, usage of tools such as "screen" is recommended.<br>
                On first run, a directory will be created to store configurations.<br>
                Check that the bot appears "online".
            </p>

            <p>
                Run the "$initialize" command on a channel.<br>
                This will be considered your "main" channel.<br>
                You may at any time run this command elsewhere to change it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The bot can only send files up to 25mbs, without relation to your Discord Nitro status.<br>
                Exceptions are servers with higher "boost" statuses.<br>
                Files that fail to send may cause the bot to silently fail.<br>
                In case you are running this bot on a VPS provider, please mind the egress fee.<br>
                The bot is designed to minimize egress whenever possible, by converting images to webp.<br>
                For extremely long text resopnses, the bot will try to fall back to .txt files.<br>
                When using some commands, the bot might take a bit to respond based on your server's speed (both network and CPU).<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                To update the bot, run git pull in the directory of the bot.py file.<br>
                Updating may change dependancies. Run pip install -r requirements.txt again.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Configuration</h3>

            <p>
                $enable or $disable features to your liking.<br>
                You may use all/AI/proactive in place of individual names.
            </p>

            <p>
                For hardcoded features (proactive):<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>HelpEverywhere: This will allow the bot to respond with hardcoded responses anywhere. (If off: only in the main channel)</li>
                    <li>ImageConversion: The bot will auto-convert heic and avif files to webp.</li>
                    <li>AudioConversion: The bot will auto-convert opus files to mp3.</li>
                    <li>TextPublish: The bot will automatically publish a txt file as a webpage.</li>
                    <li>APNGConversion: The bot will auto convert apng files to webm.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                For AI-enabled features (AI):<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>AIEnabled: Enables AI scanning in the main channel. (If off: all of the below features won't work)</li>
                    <li>AIWebScan: scans URLs for safety.</li>
                    <li>AIMediaLoad: downloads audio tracks from youtube.</li>
                    <li>AIResponse: AI responds to factual questions.</li>
                    <li>AIImagen: Generates images with Stable Diffusion.</li>
                    <li>AIAudioTrancscribe: Transcribes audio when prompted</li>
                </ul>
                The "search radius" for all AI-enabled features is 5 messages.
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy / Security</h2>

            <p>
                When AI features are enabled, the bot looks for any new message on the main channel, and sends it to Google's Gemini API for analysis.<br>
                On free tier, Google may use this collected data to improve its models.<br>
                Do not set the main channel to #general or similar.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Nothing is logged to a file by default.<br>
                Some things are printed to the terminal.<br>
                <br>
                The bot shouldn't be able to execute any code.<br>
                However, some features will cause files to be downloaded to the server briefly while it processes.<br>
                They will be deleted as soon as feasible.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Fallbacks</h2>

            <p>
                The bot will fall back to Cloudflare AI's Llama 3 model in case Gemini API fails.<br>
                This may be due to a rate limit, or because something else happened.<br>
                You may notice degraded performance when this happens.<br>
            </p>
