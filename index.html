            <h1>Hello world!</h1>

            <p>
              Programmed to work and not to feel... wait, not the song...<br>
              Hello world! Or, more precisely, hello hackclub!<br>
              This is an <a style="color: #effab6;" href="https://github.com/jcxmt125/hackclub-site">open source</a> website I'm making for <a style="color: #effab6;" href="https://hackclub.com/arcade">Hack club Arcade!</a><br>
              It's made up of simple HTML and a few style tags for most pages.<br>
              Wizard Orpheus uses JavaScript from Hack club!<br>
              3d uses a-frame and Cloudflare Workers (with beta Python support)<br>
              External links will have a different color (yellow)!<br>
              I've tried my best to make this site accessible.<br>
              However, things might not be up to standard.<br>
              Please reach out with the contact below if you have any issues!<br>
            </p>

              Well then... I'll show you some things..?<br>
            </p>

            <h3>First of all, have a rickroll.</h3>

            <video width="640" controls>
              <source src="https://random.jclink.link/serve-rickroll" type="video/webm">
              A video of either Rick Astley's song "Never gonna give you up", or a cover of it made to sound like a medival song.
            </video>

            <p>
              This should give you a random rickroll out of two possibilities...<br>
              However, it <i>might</i> be cached by your browser, in which case only one will work.
            </p>

            <h3>How about a snowflake?</h3>

            <iframe src="https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed.html" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="Snowflake widget from the Tor project"></iframe>

            <p>
              This will allow people in censored countries to connect to your browser while this tab is open.<br>
              Keep in mind, enabling this might not be the best idea if you're on a censored or monitored network.<br>
              This probably won't work on mobile.<br>
