            <p>
                You head into the space between two buildings...<br>
                It's dark in here... but there was still a strange blue glow coming from within the confines of the place.<br>
                Heading closer, you see a girl..?<br>
                <br>
                She was just... standing there motionlessly.<br>
                When you came into her field of view, her eyes moved, following you.<br>
                She didn't speak, or even move her head.<br>
                It was as if she was a doll or something...<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <a style="color: #b6defa;" href="N00.html">Go closer to investigate.</a><br>
                <a style="color: #b6defa;" href="N01.html">Get out of here before she does something weird.</a><br>
            </p>
