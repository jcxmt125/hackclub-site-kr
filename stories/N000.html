          "How may I prove that I am a robot?"<br>
          <br>
          The peculiar girl asked...<br>
          <br>
          "I... don't know, do something humans can't do?"<br>
          <br>
          "..."<br>
          <br>
          She seemed to be thinking... and then her eyes just... blacked out?<br>
          <br>
          "Aaaa?!"<br>
          <br>
          You let out a small yelp, as that wasn't the first thing on your mind.<br>
          <br>
          "...Was this satisfactory?"<br>
          <br>
          Well... that certainly wasn't something a human could do...<br>
          But, you were feeling a bit lightheaded from the shock.<br>
          Thankfully..? the... creepy girl in front of you seemed to notice.<br>
          <br>
          "Human, your vitals seem slightly unstable. Do you require assistance?"<br>

          <p>
            <a style="color: #b6defa;" href="N0000.html">"No thank you..."</a><br>
            <a style="color: #b6defa;" href="N0001.html">"Sure..?"</a><br>
          </p>
