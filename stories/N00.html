            <p>
              You head closer to her to investigate...<br>
              You say something to her.<br>
              <br>
              "Hello? Are you okay..?"<br>
              <br>
              She seems to look at you for a moment more, before saying something weird.<br>
              <br>
              "Hello. Can you understand me?"<br>
              <br>
              Her voice was clear... almost <i>too</i> clear, in fact.<br>
              From her situation, it was apparant something definitely wasn't right...<br>
              You've come too far to go back. You respond.<br>
              <br>
              "Yes, I can understand you... who are you?"<br>
              <br>
              "I am an android. Sadly, most of my data seems to have been destroyed."<br>
              <br>
              An android..? There was no chance this girl was serious, right..?<br>
              <br>
              "One thing that remains in memory is that I was designed to assist humans."<br>
              <br>
              Though, the way she talked... it certainly seemed robotic... no sane person would normally talk like that, right?<br>
