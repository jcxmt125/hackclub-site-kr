            <p>
                You decided not to investigate and continued on with your day...<br>
                <br>
                Nothing out of the ordinary happened to you while you got back home...<br>
                Or for a few days after that, or even a few months after that.<br>
                Years go by without anything weird happening...<br>
                <br>
                That is, until you notice something on the news one day.<br>
                A rouge superintelligent AI has popped up from somewhere.<br>
                It seems to have a hatred for humanity.<br>
                It... doesn't seem like there's much you can do at this point.<br>
