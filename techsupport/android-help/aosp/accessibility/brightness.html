            <p>
                This guide will help you increase or decrease the brightness of your screen.<br>
                First, try adjusting you brightness from the quick settings screen.<br>
                This will allow a pretty wide range of adjustment.<br>
                Swipe down twice from the top of your screen to open quick settings.<br>
                Find the brightness slider, and move it to the left or right.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can let your phone adjust to the brightness level of your environment.<br>
                To enable adaptive brightness, head into settings by opening the settings app, or swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the cogwheel.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Display", then tap on it.<br>
                Find "adaptive brightness", and turn it on.<br>
                If you find your screen brightness keeps changing weirdly, you may turn the setting off.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                If your screen is too bright even after pulling your slider all the way to the left, you can try "extra dim".<br>
                Head into settings by opening the settings app, or swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the cogwheel.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Accessibility", then tap it.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Extra dim", and tap it.<br>
                You may configure the settings from here.<br>
                Toggle the feature on.<br>
                Use the "intensity" slider to adjust how dark your screen will be.<br>
                "Keep on after device restarts" will persist your settings after a reboot.<br>
                You may configure a shortcut if you desire.<br>
            </p>
