            <h2>Audio too small</h2>

            <p>
                If you're experiencing audio that is too small, first try increasing your volume.<br>
                On your phone's side, there will likely be two buttons.<br>
                Press the longer one, towards the top of the phone, to increase volume.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you cannot hear small details in your sound, Sound Amplifier may help.<br>
                Head to settings, by opening the settings app, or swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the cogwheel.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Accessibility", then tap it.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Sound amplifier", and tap it.<br>
                You may be prompted to install the app. In this case, please go ahead and install it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Connect your headphones or earbuds.<br>
                Afterwards, tap "Phone media" to make small sounds louder.<br>
                Alternatively, you may tap "Phone mic" to use your phone like a hearing aid.<br>
                When using the mic option, it is recommended to use wired earbuds or headphones to minimize delay.<br>
                Adjust settings below to your liking.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Unable to know what's playing</h2>

            <p>
                Android live captions can help you understand what's playing by transcribing your audio.<br>
                Head to settings, by opening the settings app, or swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the cogwheel.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Accessibility", then tap it.<br>
                Scroll down to find "Live Caption", then tap it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              There are many options here.<br>
              Some may only be available in Google Pixel devices.<br>
              To stop using Live Captions, turn it off in settings.<br>
              Alternatively, when the captions appear, tap and hold to "grab" it, then swipe it all the way to the bottom of your screen.
            </p>

            <h2>I want my phone to help listen to things in real life.</h2>

            <p>
              You can use Live Transcribe to have your phone transcribe text<br>
              Head to settings, by opening the settings app, or swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the cogwheel.<br>
              Scroll down to find "Accessibility", then tap it.<br>
              Scroll down to find "Live Transcribe", then tap it.<br>
              Allow microphone permissions while the app is being used.<br>
              You may also tap the cogwheel icon to access more settings.
            </p>

            <p>
              From the cogwheel menu, you can also enable sound notifications.<br>
              This allows your phone to listen for doorbells, alarms and more on your behalf.<br>
