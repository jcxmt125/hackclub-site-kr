            <h1>Android help - AOSP / apps / install</h1>

            <p>
                Before we begin, I don't recommend installing the following apps:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>QR code scanning apps - your camera should already have this function</li>
                    <li>Flashlight apps - your phone already has a feature to do that.</li>
                    <li>"Optimizer" apps - They usually don't work, and will slow your phone down.</li>
                    <li>Any apps that have the current year in the icon or name - They're likely clones of legitimate apps.</li>
                </ul>
                Use your own judgement.<br>
                If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br>
                Fradulent apps can be dangerous.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's begin.<br>
                Open the play store on your device.<br>
                You may have to go into your app drawer to find it!<br>
                From your home screen, swipe up to open your app drawer.<br>
                It should show all of your installed apps.<br>
                Search for the play store, and tap it to open.<br>
                Alternatively, ask the Google Assistant, or scoll to find the app.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Tap the search bar on the top section.<br>
                (Depending on what google thinks today, it might also be on the bottom as a button.)<br>
                Search for the app you want to install.<br>
                Tap the app you want to install to open its details page.<br>
                If you'd like to go ahead with the install, tap the install button.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you see a price instead of the install button, the app is not a free app.<br>
                Consider using an alternative, or if you're sure, follow the steps to add a payment method to your Google account.<br>
            </p>
